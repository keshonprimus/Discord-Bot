# Discord-Bot
This Discord Bot was developed and modelled to manage communication within discord servers by monitoring and
removing explicit language.
The Bot also has slash command prompts for telling jokes, answering questins, and providing inspirational quotes on slash-command prompts
The Discord Bot is maintained in a personal Discord server via hosting in a cloud server that is linked to Discord
